This header file defines a bare-metal GPIO driver for STM32F446xx microcontrollers, providing direct register access without HAL/LL library dependencies. It includes all necessary data structures for GPIO pin configuration (GPIO_PinConfig_t) and handle management (GPIO_Handle_t), along with comprehensive macros for pin numbers, modes, output types, speeds, and pull-up/down configurations. The driver exposes essential APIs for GPIO initialization, clock control, input/output operations, and interrupt handling, enabling low-level hardware control. The implementation supports all basic GPIO functionalities including digital I/O, alternate functions, and interrupt configurations with edge detection, making it suitable for resource-constrained embedded applications requiring direct hardware access.
